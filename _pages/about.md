I am a  first-year PhD candidate at the Centre d'économie de la Sorbonne (CES) and the Sorbonne School of Economics under the supervision of Prof. [Remi Bazillier](https://remibazillier.wordpress.com). 

My research explores labor markets in developing economies, with a focus on wage determination. I am particularly interested in understanding how informality and urbanization influence labor market opportunities and outcomes for workers. Additionally, I examine the role of labor market regulations in these contexts. My current work investigates the effects of minimum wage policies in India on workers in both the formal and informal sectors. As an applied econometrician, I leverage natural experiments to address my research questions, utilizing survey data, geographic data, and big data techniques to analyze outcomes.

I hold a Master's degree in Development Economics from [University of Paris 1: Panthéon Sorbonne](https://economie.pantheonsorbonne.fr) and dual Bachelor's degrees in Economics and International Relations from [Simmons University (Boston, USA)](https://www.simmons.edu).
